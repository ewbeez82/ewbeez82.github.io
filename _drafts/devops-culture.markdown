[This][1] is a pretty good article about tools vs culture in devops. I want to investigate some other things about this topic because that's what makes it work.  It's really not the tools.  It's the culture.

[This][2] is pretty good too.


* Keep everything in version control
* Automate all of the things
* Instrement all of the things
* Always ask why
* Always improve the process
* Strive for high quality
* Keep things simple as possible
* Learn, keep learning
* “You can’t directly change culture. But you can change behavior, and behavior becomes culture” – Lloyd Taylor VP Infrastructure, Ngmoco
* Create a software developer friendly culture at the company level


Interesting resources
* [Adrian Cockcroft][3]
* [Eric Ries][4]
* [Cool Netflix][5] culture presentation, very nice.  I need to look at this a few times!
